# RaiderRide

An effort to replace Texas Tech University's current ridesharing solution

Here you can watch and even participate in the development on a student-built ridesharing app.

If you want to contribute, follow [our guidelines](https://github.com/ttugdsc/raiderride-FUBU/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md).

## Order of business

- Build mocks
  - Landing
  - Signup flow
  - Login flow
  - Home
  - Order flow
  - Driver side interactions
  - etc.

Once design is finished we pivot to development
- Scaffold React Native project
- Organize order of work logically
- Frequent meetings

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

``` yarn install ```

Then build the app for the respective platform:

``` yarn run ios ```

or

``` yarn run android```

Then, to use the maps functionality, you need to set up an API key, which you can do by following this guide:
